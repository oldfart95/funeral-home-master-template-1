            Thinking about the end of life can be hard. However, making plans now is one of the best gifts you can give to your family. For Catholics, planning ahead is also a way to show our faith. We believe that death is not the end. It is a change. We believe that we will be with God.

            We offer comprehensive cremation and burial services for Catholic families. Both options are available and fully respected within the teachings of the Catholic Church. <strong>Important:</strong> The Catholic Church requires that all remains, whether cremated or not, must be interred in consecrated ground, such as a Catholic cemetery. This sacred requirement honors the dignity of the human body and reflects our faith in the resurrection. We offer comprehensive services for both cremation and burial, ensuring all arrangements align with Catholic teachings and your family's wishes.

              The Catholic Church has important rules that apply to both burial and cremation. The Dioceses of Youngstown, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh all agree on these important rules:
            </p>
            <ol class="space-y-4 text-sm md:text-base text-text">
              <li class="flex items-start">
                <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">1.</span>
                <span><strong>The Ashes Must Be Buried:</strong> You cannot keep the ashes on a shelf at home. You cannot keep them in a closet. The ashes must be buried in a grave or placed in a special wall called a columbarium. This should happen soon after the funeral.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="flex items-start">
                <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">2.</span>
                <span><strong>Sacred Ground:</strong> The Church wants us to be buried in a sacred place. A Catholic cemetery is the best place. This is holy ground. It ensures that you are not forgotten. It gives your family a place to visit and pray for you.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="flex items-start">
                <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">3.</span>
                <span><strong>No Scattering:</strong> You are not allowed to scatter ashes. You cannot scatter them in the wind, on the ground, or in the water.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="flex items-start">
                <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">4.</span>
                <span><strong>Do Not Divide the Ashes:</strong> All the ashes must stay together. You cannot split them up among different family members. You cannot put them into jewelry, like necklaces or rings. You cannot put them into art or other objects.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="flex items-start">
                <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">5.</span>
                <span><strong>Burial at Sea:</strong> Scattering ashes on top of the water is not allowed. However, you can bury the ashes at sea if they are in a heavy container that sinks. This acts like a burial in the ground.</span>

              These rules might seem strict, but they are there for a reason. They remind us that we belong to God. When we are buried in a cemetery, we are resting with other members of our Church family. We are waiting together for the day when Jesus returns. Keeping the ashes together shows that we are one whole person. We do not want to be scattered or separated. We want to rest in peace in a holy place.

                question: "Can non-Catholics be buried in a Catholic cemetery?",
                answer: "Usually, yes. If you have a family member who is not Catholic, they can often be buried with you. The Church believes that families should stay together."

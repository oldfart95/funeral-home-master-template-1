            For a long time, the Catholic Church did not allow cremation. In 1963, the Church changed this rule. Now, Catholics are allowed to be cremated. However, the Church still prefers that the body be buried. This is because Jesus was buried in a tomb. We want to follow His example.

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-text leading-relaxed">
            Even though cremation is allowed, there are special rules we must follow. These rules show respect for the human body. Our bodies are holy. They are "temples of the Holy Spirit." We believe that one day, God will raise our bodies up again. Because of this, we must treat ashes with the same respect as a full body.

            If you choose cremation, the Dioceses of Youngstown, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh all agree on these important rules:

          <ol class="space-y-4 text-sm md:text-base text-text">
            <li class="flex items-start">

              <span><strong>The Ashes Must Be Buried:</strong> You cannot keep the ashes on a shelf at home. You cannot keep them in a closet. The ashes must be buried in a grave or placed in a special wall called a columbarium. This should happen soon after the funeral.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">2.</span>
              <span><strong>Sacred Ground:</strong> The Church wants us to be buried in a sacred place. A Catholic cemetery is the best place. This is holy ground. It ensures that you are not forgotten. It gives your family a place to visit and pray for you.</span>
            </li>

              <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">3.</span>
              <span><strong>No Scattering:</strong> You are not allowed to scatter ashes. You cannot scatter them in the wind, on the ground, or in the water.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">4.</span>
              <span><strong>Do Not Divide the Ashes:</strong> All the ashes must stay together. You cannot split them up among different family members. You cannot put them into jewelry, like necklaces or rings. You cannot put them into art or other objects.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="font-bold text-primary mr-3">5.</span>
              <span><strong>Burial at Sea:</strong> Scattering ashes on top of the water is not allowed. However, you can bury the ashes at sea if they are in a heavy container that sinks. This acts like a burial in the ground.</span>

            These rules might seem strict, but they are there for a reason. They remind us that we belong to God. When we are buried in a cemetery, we are resting with other members of our Church family. We are waiting together for the day when Jesus returns. Keeping the ashes together shows that we are one whole person. We do not want to be scattered or separated. We want to rest in peace in a holy place.

              {
                question: "Do I need to buy an urn?",
                answer: "Yes. You will need a container for the ashes. This is called an urn. You can choose from many different types. Some are made of wood, metal, or stone. The urn should be respectful and dignified. It should not be a toy or a joke item. It should be worthy of holding a holy person."

            The rules for cremation are very similar across all our local areas. Whether you are in the Diocese of Youngstown (which includes Canton) or the Diocese of Cleveland (which includes Akron), the goal is the same. We want to treat your loved one with great respect. We want to make sure they are buried in a holy place.
